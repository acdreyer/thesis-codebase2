					<p>During World War I aircraft technology was in its infancy and it prompted the 
					United States to establish the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1915. 
					Subsequently great advances were made by scientists and aviators and NACA advanced commercial 
					and military aviation through research and development activities. By the time World War II broke out, 
					NACA was well established as a leading aerospace research institution.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div id="top-summary-right">
					<p>The NACA’s research made it the obvious choice for the US 
					Congress when the space race began in earnest. The NACA 
					agency’s operational research model was ideal for advancing 
					development from aerospace to space and in 1958 the National 
					Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created, 
					making the NACA the core of NASA.</p>
